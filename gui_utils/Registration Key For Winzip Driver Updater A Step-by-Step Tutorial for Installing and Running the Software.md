## How to check your current version of IntelliJ IDEA
 
Before you upgrade to IntelliJ IDEA 12.21, you need to check your current version of the IDE and make sure that it is compatible with the new version. To do that:

1. Open IntelliJ IDEA on your computer.
2. Go to **Help** > **About**.
3. A dialog box will appear that shows your current version number and build date.

If your current version is lower than 12.21 (for example, 12.20 or 11.0), you can proceed with the upgrade process. If your current version is already 12.21 or higher (for example, 13.0 or 14.0), you don't need to upgrade as you already have the latest version.
