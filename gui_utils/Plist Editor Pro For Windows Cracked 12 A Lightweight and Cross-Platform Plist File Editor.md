To open a plist file, you can click on the File menu and select Open, or use the Ctrl+O keyboard shortcut. You can also drag and drop a plist file into the main window. You will see the contents of the plist file in either XML-text mode or property-list mode, depending on your preference.
 
In XML-text mode, you can see the raw text of the plist file with syntax highlighting. You can edit the text directly in this mode, but you need to be careful not to make any syntax errors. You can also use the Find and Replace functions to search for specific text or values in the plist file.

You can also edit the property name, type, and value of each node by double-clicking on it or using the right-click menu. You can also add, delete, copy, paste, or move nodes by using the toolbar buttons or the right-click menu.
