Menzoberranzan has a long and complex history, dating back to its founding in -3917 DR by a group of drow exiles from the city of Golothaer. The exiles were led by Menzoberra the Kinless, a powerful priestess of Lolth who claimed to have received a vision from the goddess. She named the city after herself and established House Baenre as the first and most dominant house. [16]
 
Over the centuries, Menzoberranzan witnessed many wars, intrigues, and upheavals, both internal and external. The city fought against rival drow cities such as Ched Nasad and Guallidurth, as well as other Underdark races such as illithids, duergar, and svirfneblin. The city also faced threats from the surface world, such as the Time of Troubles in 1358 DR, when Lolth went silent and chaos erupted among the drow. [17]
 
In 1372 DR, Menzoberranzan was shaken by another crisis known as the Silence of Lolth, when the Spider Queen again withdrew her favor from her followers. This event sparked a civil war among the drow houses, as well as an invasion by a coalition of surface races led by King Bruenor Battlehammer of Mithral Hall. The war ended with a stalemate, but left many houses weakened or destroyed. [18]
 
Menzoberranzan is home to about 20,000 drow and 40,000 slaves of various races. The city is divided into eight districts, each controlled by one of the ruling houses. The most powerful house is House Baenre, followed by House Barrison Del'Armgo, House Faen Tlabbar, House Xorlarrin, House Agrach Dyrr, House Mizzrym, House Do'Urden (formerly House Oblodra), and House Fey-Branche. [19]
 
The city is governed by a council of eight matron mothers, one from each ruling house. The council is nominally led by Matron Mother Quenthel Baenre of House Baenre, but in reality she must contend with the schemes and ambitions of her rivals. The council also includes representatives from other influential groups in the city, such as the Academy (the center of education and training for young drow), the Bazaar (the hub of commerce and trade), and the Spider Queen's temple (the main religious institution).
