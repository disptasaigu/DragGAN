# How to Use VirtualHere for Steam Link to Enhance Your Gaming Experience
 
VirtualHere for Steam Link is a software that allows you to use various USB devices, such as XBox One wireless controller, steering wheel, microphone, headphones, flight stick, PS3 controller, bluetooth adapter, and more, directly on your Steam Link device. This improves the compatibility and performance of your gaming controllers and peripherals, as it transmits the actual USB signal between the Steam Link and your remote PC. The remote PC thinks the USB device is local to it, whereas really it's plugged into your Steam Link.
 
In this article, we will show you how to use VirtualHere for Steam Link to enhance your gaming experience. You will need a Steam Link device, a PC with Steam installed, a USB device that you want to use with Steam Link, and a copy of VirtualHere for Steam Link software from the Steam store.
